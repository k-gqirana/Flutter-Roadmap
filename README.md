# Flutter-Roadmap 

The purpose of this repo is to document my Flutter development roadmap. When adopting a new tech stack, my first point of reference is always [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship). Fireship's breakdown is short, concise, and provides great insight (i.e. dos and don'ts, tricks and shortcuts, etc.) - [Fireship's Breakdown of Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xipg02Wu8s&t=184s). 

The next step is getting into the fundamentals. For this, I like taking a tutorial playlist with short videos and small code samples to avoid being overwhelmed - [Flutter Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=flutter+tutorial).

Finally, I take a bootcamp with in-depth explanations and projects to drive the topics home - [freeCodeCamp Flutter for Beginners 37-hour course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPvVD8t02U8&t=85s). For this roadmap, I'll also be documenting my progress on a Word document, explaining the topics learned with code snippets - [Progress Documentation](https://livenmmuac-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/s216057361_mandela_ac_za/Ef5MM7ew1z1OkthDYBrseZUBK_dRxiiRfQYqqWkQCx80jw?e=Myu1JE).
