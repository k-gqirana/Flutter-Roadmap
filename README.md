# Flutter-Roadmap 

The purpose of this repo is to document my flutter development roadmap. When adopting a new tech stack, my first point of refernece is always [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship). Fireship's breaksdown breakdown is short, conscice nd provides great insight (i.e. dos and donts, tricks and shortcuts etc.) [Fireship's Breakdown of Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xipg02Wu8s&t=184s). The next step is getting into the fundemntals. For this I like taking a tutorial playlist with short videos and small code samples, to avoid being overwhelmed, [Flutter Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=flutter+tutorial). Finally, I take a bootcamp with indepth explanations and projects, to drive the topics home, [freeCodeCamp Flutter for Beginners 37 hour course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPvVD8t02U8&t=85s). For this roadmap I'll also be documenting my progress on a word document, explaining the topics learnt with code snippets, [Progress Documentation](https://livenmmuac-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/s216057361_mandela_ac_za/Ef5MM7ew1z1OkthDYBrseZUBK_dRxiiRfQYqqWkQCx80jw?e=Myu1JE).
